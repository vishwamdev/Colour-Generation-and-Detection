# Project Work
1) Generation of red, green, and blue colours in RGB LED separately with interval of 2 seconds using MBed platform.

2) Generation of Yellow, Purple and White colours in RGB LED separately with interval of 2 seconds using MBed platform.

3) Decreasing the final colour(White) intensity from Max to 0(Dimming effect) and to repeat the process (Dimming process is completed within approximately 5s period).

4) Generating  colour transition sequence as follows;

            a) Increase intensity > Steady for 2s > Decrease intensity (Red) 
            b) Increase intensity > Steady for 2s > Decrease intensity (Green) 
            c) Increase intensity > Steady for 2s > Decrease intensity (White)

 5) Displaying the colour (White) intensity level during the dimming process on the Mbed display.
